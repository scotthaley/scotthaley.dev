# How I Built This Website

<Published>Published Feb 19th, 2025</Published>

If you just want to see how I built this and you don't care about my
advice on deciding how to start a new project, skip to 
[How I Built This Website (For Real This Time)](#for-real).

## Choosing a stack

Choosing your tech stack when starting a new project seems like it
would be pretty important. This is a decision you will have to live
with for the rest of the life of the project, right?

Something that is both a blessing and a curse in software
development is that most things can be built with most things. There
are certain technologies or languages that have certain advantages
or disadvantages for certain types of applications, but by and
large, you can build your app with whatever stack you want.

When it comes to building a website, not only is it possible to use
pretty much any language, most languages have a modern, open source,
framework that will get you started quickly.

For example, I've been working in Rust quite a bit lately for a game
I'm working on using [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/), so let's say I
wanted to build this website using Rust. I could get a project up
and running quickly with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/).

Okay, I admit I haven't actually used Rocket, but it looks pretty
nice, doesn't it? Similar frameworks exist for
[Go](https://gin-gonic.com/),
[Python](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/),
[Elixir](https://www.phoenixframework.org/),
[C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet),
[C++](https://drogon.org/),
[Java](https://spring.io/),
[Zig](https://github.com/zigzap/zap),
[PHP](https://laravel.com/),
[Ruby](https://rubyonrails.org/),
[Swift](https://vapor.codes/),
[Kotlin](https://ktor.io/),
[and about a hundred in JavaScript/TypeScript](https://technostacks.com/blog/best-javascript-frameworks/#:~:text=Answer%3A%20There%20are%20at%20least,js%2C%20react.). You could also just do it the old fashioned way and build
something with vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS and would do just fine
(although I probably wouldn't if I was building anything more than a
basic static website).

## So then how do I pick?

There are a few things to consider when picking a tech stack.

1. Do I want to build something quickly?
2. Do I want to learn something new?
3. Do I care about performance?

### Build Quickly vs. Learn Something New

I'd argue you can't prioritize both of these things. There's
certainly merit to both. You can't really learn a new thing without
actually building something with it. If you want to build something
quickly you should stick with what you already know. This gets a
little more nuanced if the thing you know isn't a JS or TS
framework.

For example, if the language you are most comfortable in is Go, then
your best bet to build something quickly is to use Go. However, if
the thing you are wanting to build is a very frontend heavy
application that needs complicated state management, it would
probably be a good idea to learn a JS framework to handle that. In
my opinion, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is one of the
easier ones to learn. [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
might also be a good option.

### Prioritizing Performance

This might actually be the most nuanced decision point. Performant
applications can be built on pretty much any tech stack and in the
world of web development, there's really only one category that is
_probably_ going to be less performant, and that is client-side
JS/TS frameworks.

A client-side JS/TS framework (like React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.)
works by running a full application client-side (in the browser)
that is responsible for fetching data, rendering, and handling
events. For a sufficiently complex application, a website built on
this type of technology is going to _feel_ more performant if
built well if for no other reason than because the application state
can update without needing to load a new page. Imagine an instant
messaging app that reloads the whole page every time you send or
recieve a new message.

If you are building a website that doesn't have this type of
stateful complexity (like this one), then you might get a better
experience by going with a server-side rendered (SSR) application.
SSR is just a fancy way of describing the way all websites worked
until we started building these complex JS applications that handle
the rendering client-side. Any of the non-JS/TS frameworks mentioned
earlier are examples of SSR frameworks. All this means is that the
actual HTML and CSS that ends up getting rendered in the browser is
created on the server which is then downloaded in its entirety
rather than the server providing the actual _application_
responsible for creating that HTML and CSS.

<Note>
The term **rendering** in "client-side rendering" and
"server-side rendering" is misleading in my opinion. I would
consider the process of rendering to be the part of the system
that actually paints pixels on the screen, which for anything
running in the browser, this is all handled by the
**rendering engine** in the browser. The
**rendering engine** takes HTML and CSS, and translates that to
the actual pixels you see on your screen.

When we are talking about client-side versus server-side
rendering, we are actually referring to where the actual HTML and
CSS that will be rendered by the browser is generated. It's not
technically wrong to call what happens here "rendering", just
don't get it confused with the computer graphics definition of the
term.
</Note>

There is also a category of frameworks that give a good middleground
between client-side and server-side rendering. Frameworks like
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), and
[Remix](https://remix.run) provide mechanisms for mixing
client-side and server-side rendering depending on the type of
content. Typically, this type of framework works via a process
called **"hydration"** which basically means the full initial
HTML and CSS is generated server side which is then "taken over" by
the client-side application. If the initial server-side state
matches the initial client-side state (which most frameworks attempt
to ensure) then there will be no noticible difference when the
client-side application takes over. This strategy gives you most of
the benefits of both rendering strategies at the expense of some
complexity and a larger download bundle than a pure server-side
rendering strategy.

### Deploying My App

Another important part of the tech stack to consider is how you will
deploy your app. This topic is much too big to cover in any sort of
detail in this article, but I did want to take the opportunity to
give some advice. These days there are about as many ways to deploy
your app as there are ways to build the app.

You could containerize your application and deploy on some sort of
managed container service like Azure App Service or Amazon Elastic
Container Service (ECS). If you are a masochist you could deploy
your own kubernetes instance and deploy your containerized app that
way. You could also provision an AWS EC2 instance or Azure VM and
run your app on that with some sort of network gateway and
potentially a load balancer. You could do a similar thing using
Digital Ocean or Rackspace. Depending on how you built the
application, you could also host the app statically in AWS S3 and
then use AWS Lambda functions for any sort of server-side logic you
might need.

There are a ton of incredible tools available to you to solve all
kinds of scalability, security, and cost problems. For personal
projects, these tools solve all of these problems easily, because
**you probably won't launch your application at all because you'll 
spend all of your time trying to figure out DevOps things.**

Instead, you should look to a platform that will manage all of this
for you. There are a few different ones that I've personally had
success with: Firebase, Digital Ocean App Platform, and Vercel.
These platforms connect to your git repository, and handle all of
the DevOps stuff for you. They handle networking, load balancing,
CI/CD, and in Vercel's case even provide tools for QA.

Even if you are planning on building a huge website with tons of
users and traffic, deploy first on something like Vercel and then
migrate when it is necessary.

## What stack did I pick?

Taking my own advice, I went with a tech stack that I was already
very familiar with because I wanted to get this up and running
quickly so I could have a place to write about the other projects I
have that are more focused on learning things.

As I've already hinted at, this website is a good use case for a
server-side rendered application since it is largely static and has
no complex state management needs. I could have gone with a pure SSR
solution, but because I'm planning on doing some prototypes and
experiments that will be more complex, I decided to go with{" "}
**Next.js** which gives me a good middleground between
server-side and client-side rendering. This choice has the added
benefit of being a framework that I've used heavily recently.

Another benefit of going with Next.js, is it integrates well with
**Vercel** which is currently my favorite way to deploy an
application. Vercel has a nice boilerplate setup for Next.js that
also includes **Tailwind CSS**, which I've also made use of.

## How I Built This Website (For Real This Time)
</div>

I'm not trying to make this an ad for Vercel, but I do love Vercel
and it allowed me to get this website up and running quickly. There
are a few ways to set up a project on Vercel, but the fastest way
when creating a new project is to clone one of their templates.
 
After logging into Vercel, and choosing to create a new project, I
get presented with this screen:

![Screenshot of new project page in Vercel](/vercel-create-new.png)

Because I've logged into Vercel using GitHub SSO, Vercel already has
access to my GitHub account. If you created your account a different
way, you would need to authenticate separately with your git
provider under Account Settings.

I could choose to import an existing repository, which would
create the project in Vercel and set up everything I need for CI/CD,
but in this case I'm going to choose to clone the Next.js
Boilerplate project since this was a new project.

<div className="w-3/4 m-auto">
  ![Screenshot of clone nextjs modal in Vercel](/vercel-clone-nextjs.png)
</div>

From here, I can choose the name for my repository, and after
clicking "Create", Vercel will create this project for me in my
GitHub account, set up the project, and finally deploy the project.

After this is done deploying, I can then clone the new repo that was
created, and I'm ready to begin working on my new application.
Everything will already be set up by Vercel to handle deploying new
versions whenever I push changes to the repo. It's worth learning
how to set something like this up manually, but when trying to get a
project up and running quickly, this is a great solution.

### Adding a custom domain name

Vercel also makes adding a custom domain name _very_ easy.
Again, this is something that would be worth learning how to do
manually, but having a way to do this quickly is extremely valuable.

First navigate to the "Domains" tab in Vercel (if you don't see
this, it might be because you are in the context of a project, and
need to click the Vercel logo in the top right to go up a level).

![Screenshot showing where the domains tab is in Vercel](/vercel-domains.png)

Next click the "Buy" button to purchase a new domain.

![Screenshot showing where the buy button is under domains in Vercel](/vercel-domains-buy.png)

Finally, search for a domain you'd like to purchase, and then
purchase a domain.

![Screenshot showing where the buy button is under domains in Vercel](/vercel-domains-list.png)

After you have purchased your domain, go back to your project, then
Settings, then "Domains". Click the "Add" button, and then select
the domain you just purchased in the dropdown, leave environment on
"Production" (assuming you want this domain for the production
deployment), leave redirect to at "No Redirect" and click "Add
Domain". You can choose to set up a redirect to "www." if you'd
like, (I just went with the recommended option).

It will take a minute or so for Vercel to set up the proper DNS
settings and certificates, but once it looks like the screenshot
below, your custom domain should be pointing to your website!

![Screenshot showing how to add a custom domain to a project in Vercel](/vercel-domain-assign.png)

<Note>
Domain names work on a system called DNS (Domain Name System)
which works off of different servers that map domain names to the
IP address of your server. When DNS settings are changed, which
Vercel handles for you here, it might take some amount of time for
those settings to propogate to different DNS servers. Usually this
happens within a few minutes, but don't stress if your domain name
doesn't work right away.
</Note>

### Everything else

Without making this a Next.js tutorial, there's not much else to
cover here. Feel free to check out the repo for this project
[here](https://github.com/scotthaley/scotthaley.dev). In
some later articles I will describe how specifically things on this
site are built, but for now, hopefully you got something out of this
article when it comes to the decisions around your tech stack when
starting a new project.
