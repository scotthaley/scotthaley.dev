# Markdown, Please

<Accent>Published Feb 21st, 2025</Accent>

I knew from the beginning making this website that I'd want the ability
to write my articles using markdown, but in an effort to get something
up and running quickly, I just did my first [article](/blog/1) in plain old HTML.

I thought I might need to write a preprocessor myself to convert markdown
files to the correct format, but it turns Next.js already has a good solution
for this!

This article from the Next.js team does a great job at explaining how to setup
your Next.js application to work with markdown:

<BigLink url="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx" />

## Implementation for <span className="font-thin">scotthaley.dev</span>

First thing was to add the `withMDX` plugin to Next.js.

```typescript
---
file: /next.config.ts
---
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

In our `next.config.ts` file, we create an instance of the MDX plugin
and wrap our `nextConfig` with `withMDX()`.

The next thing we need to do is create a `mdx-components.tsx` file in our project root directory.
The MDX plugin will not work without this file.

```tsx
---
file: /mdx-components.tsx
---
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import Image, { ImageProps } from "next/image";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    h1: ({ children }) => (
      <div className="mb-10 border-b-theme-2 border-b-2 w-full px-6">
        <h1>{children}</h1>
      </div>
    ),
    h2: ({ children }) => <h2 className="px-6">{children}</h2>,
    h3: ({ children }) => <h3 className="px-6">{children}</h3>,
    h4: ({ children }) => <h4 className="px-6">{children}</h4>,
    h5: ({ children }) => <h5 className="px-6">{children}</h5>,
    h6: ({ children }) => <h6 className="px-6">{children}</h6>,
    p: ({ children }) => <p className="mb-4 px-6">{children}</p>,
    ol: ({ children }) => (
      <ol className="list-decimal mt-4 list-inside my-8 px-6">{children}</ol>
    ),
    img: (props) => (
      <Image
        sizes="100vw"
        width={0}
        height={0}
        className="shadow-lg rounded-lg"
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
        {...(props as ImageProps)}
      />
    ),
    ...components,
  };
}
```

There's probably a better way I could have worked out to add the padding I want
(this padding is so that the horizontal line on the header is slightly larger than the 
width of the content) but this was a pretty quick way to solve the problem.

With the MDX plugin, your markdown will be converted to HTML tags, and this `useMDXComponents`
function allows you to map those HTML tags to whatever you want. I've added some basic 
styling to my header tags and ordered lists, and I've also mapped the `img` tag to 
the Next.js `Image` component.

The next thing I wanted to add was a nice way to format text for the "Published" text
at the top of each article.

<Accent>Talking about this format...</Accent>

I found I can add any arbitrary tag to this list and then use that tag in my markdown files.
So I added a `Accent` tag so that I can format this the way I want.

```tsx
---
file: /mdx-components.tsx
---
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import Image, { ImageProps } from "next/image";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...,
    Accent: ({ children }) => (
      <p className="mb-8 text-theme-6 text-md px-6">
        <i>{children}</i>
      </p>
    ),
    ...components,
  };
}
```

Now I can use this tag in my markdown files like so:

```markdown
# Markdown, Please

<Accent>Published Feb 21st, 2025</Accent>

I knew from the beginning making this website that I'd want the ability...
```

I also added a tag for my Note sections:

```tsx
---
file: /mdx-components.tsx
---
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import Image, { ImageProps } from "next/image";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...,
    Accent: ({ children }) => (
      <p className="mb-8 text-theme-6 text-md px-6">
        <i>{children}</i>
      </p>
    ),
    Note: ({ children }) => (
      <div className="px-6">
        <div className="my-8 p-4 bg-theme-6 text-theme-1 font-semibold flex rounded-lg">
          <div className="mr-4 font-bold">Note:</div>
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    ...components,
  };
}
```

<Note>
You will get a React error if you don't make these custom tags start with a capital letter.

Then all I had to do was convert my one article I had written to markdown! Bonus value
that it's now much easier to read these pages in [GitHub](https://github.com/scotthaley/scotthaley.dev/blob/main/app/blog/1/page.mdx).
